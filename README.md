# Frogger
This was a semester-long project for CS 2340 (Objects and Design). Due to course policies, I created it using my Georgia Tech GitHub account. You can view it at [https://github.gatech.edu/CS-2340-Team-37/Frogger](https://github.gatech.edu/CS-2340-Team-37/Frogger). Feel free to watch the walkthrough video in this respository as well!
